% === CHAPTER ==================================================================
\chapter{Introduction: TODO}
\label{chap:intro}

User wants to know the value of some variable in the program. He/she can run
debugger of choice, set breakpoint at the selected variable location and let
debugger execute input program step by step until it reaches the selected
variable. Finally, debugger steps on the targeted variable and thus can extract
its value and provide it back to the user.

The procedure described above is usually part of the standard standard approach
when user want to get value of some selected variable during the program
execution. Unfortunately, this approach is cumbersome in case when user want to
execute above procedure many times. Procedure consists of many manual steps
which is time consuming to perform. Ideally, there could be script that takes
line of code (or variable name) as an input and produces output with the value
of the selected target

Normally, this method would require to use debugger with the scripting support
and write scripts that would instruct debugger what exactly to do, basically
replicating the manual approach.

Instead of scripting debugger to do the extraction, we could write tool that
would accept the same user input as the approach above (line of code/variable
name), run analysis on where the execution flow in the program would occur to
get to the target instruction and transplant subset of the input program into
separate binary.

This way, user will have separate, executable that upon running would produce
value of the targeted instruction, without having to manually step thought or
script debugger.

This thesis aims to devise method and implement this method in a tool for
statically transplanting a subset of a C program. Using the devised method, the
selected program subset should be extracted from the original program provided
by the user and synthesized as an independent, executable binary.

Proposed solution should be implemented in a tool having appropriate form,
either as a standalone application or an LLVM plugin. It should easily accept
user to provide their own input programs.

Finally, tool should be used to test at least two real-world open-source C
programs in order to find where the room for improvements is and what could be
improved in the future.


% summary of the thesis

The following sections of this thesis are structured as follows.
In the \autoref{chap:llvm} we will briefly introduce the LLVM compiler
infrastructure.  Explain what makes it so popular and why we picked this tool
for our implementation.
The following \autoref{chap:design}, we will introduce method that is the basis
of this thesis aim.
We will devote \autoref{chap:implementation} for explaining specific details
and intricacies of implementation.
Experiments and their results will be discussed in the chapter
\autoref{chap:experiments}. Finally \autoref{chap:conclusions} summarizes the
results of this thesis and describes possible further research and development
opportunities.


\chapter{The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure: TODO}
\label{chap:llvm}

"The LLVM (FOOTNOTE:The name "LLVM" itself is not an acronym; it is the full
name of the project.) Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler
and toolchain technologies." \cite{llvm}

"an umbrella project that hosts and develops a set of close-knit low-level
toolchain components (e.g., assemblers, compilers, debuggers, etc.), which are
designed to be compatible with existing tools typically used on Unix systems"

"the main thing that sets LLVM apart from other compilers is its internal
architecture." [6] Primary subprojects:

LLVM core clang ...  Strengths: "A major strength of LLVM is its versatility,
flexibility, and reusability"

\section{Intermediate Representation}
\label{sec:llvm-ir}

% subsection
Introduction
- IR AKA LLVM assembly language AKA LLVM

- "LLVM is a Static Single Assignment (SSA) based representation that provides
type safety, low-level operations, flexibility, and the capability of
representing ‘all’ high-level languages cleanly. It is the common code
representation used throughout all phases of the LLVM compilation strategy."

- Aims:
 - "The LLVM representation aims to be light-weight and low-level while being
 expressive, typed, and extensible at the same time."

- Representations of IR:
 - as an in-memory compiler IR
 - as an on-disk bitcode representation (suitable for fast loading by a
 Just-In-Time compiler)
 - as a human readable assembly language representation

% subsection
Example of the IR

We have the following C function add

\begin{minted}[ framesep=2mm,
                autogobble,
                frame=lines]{C}
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a+b;
}
\end{minted}

When using clang compiler with -emit-llvm flag, we get the following representation in IR:

\begin{minted}[ framesep=2mm,
                autogobble,
                frame=lines]{llvm}
define i32 @add(i32 %a, i32 %b) #0 {
entry:
  %a.addr = alloca i32, align 4
  %b.addr = alloca i32, align 4
  store i32 %a, i32* %a.addr, align 4
  store i32 %b, i32* %b.addr, align 4
  %0 = load i32, i32* %a.addr, align 4
  %1 = load i32, i32* %b.addr, align 4
  %add = add nsw i32 %0, %1
  ret i32 %add
\end{minted}

% subsection
High Level Structure

- Module structure:
 - functions
 - global variables
 - symbol table entries

- using LLVM linker for module combination
 - we will use this in practice

- Functions:
 - "A function definition contains a list of basic blocks, forming the CFG
 (Control Flow Graph) for the function."
 - PHI nodes


\section{Optimisations}
\label{sec:llvm-opt}

LLVM uses the concept of Passes for the optimisations. Concrete optimisations
are implemented as Passes that work with some portion of program code (e.g.
Module, Function, Loop, etc.) to collect or transform this portion of the code.
\cite{llvm-passes}

There are the following types of passes:

Analysis passes
- Analysis passes collect information from the IR and feed it into the other
passes. They can be also used for the debugging purposes, for example pass that
counts number of functions in the module.

Examples:

- basiccg: Basic CallGraph Construction
- dot-callgraph: Print Call Graph to “dot” file
- instcount: Counts the various types of Instructions

Transform passes
- Transform passes change the program in some way. They can use some analysis
pass that has been ran before and produced some information.

Examples:

- dce: Dead Code Elimination
- loop-deletion: Delete dead loops
- loop-unroll: Unroll loops

Utility passes
- Utility passes do not fit into analysis passes or transform passes categories.

Examples:

- verify: Module Verifier
- view-cfg: View CFG of function
- instnamer: Assign names to anonymous instructions

\section{Clang}
\label{sec:llvm-clang}

"The Clang project provides a language front-end and tooling infrastructure for
languages in the C language family"

Features and Goals (some overview of clang):
- End-User Features
- Utility and Applications
- Internal Design and Implementation

AST
- what is AST
- AST in clang
- Differences between clang AST and other compilers ASTs
- We will not use clangs AST, we will work directly with IR, it better suits
this project


% === CHAPTER: Design of the Method ============================================
\chapter{Extracting Program Subsets: WIP}
\label{chap:design}

% introduction

In this chapter, we will introduce the method for extracting parts of programs
from the provided user input. The presented method will not randomly extract
program parts, that would not be useful. Instead, the method determines what
parts of the input program to extract according to the user input. Besides C
source code, user also provides integer value that represents line of code
corresponding to the input C source code. We will call this integer value
\textbf{target}.  Our procedure will subsequently calculate possible execution
path up to the target that user provided and extracts this execution path into
the separate, functioning executable.

The whole procedure from the user perspective (including the desired result we
want to achieve) may look like this:

% next point
\begin{myItemize}
\item Lets say the user provided us with the input in the form of the following
C program source code that is stored in the file \mintinline{text}{example.c}:

\begin{minted}[label=example.c,frame=lines,framesep=10pt,linenos]{C}
int foo(int n) {
    int x = n + 10;
    return x;
}

int bar(void) {
    int y = 42;
    return y;
}

int main(void) {
    int some_int = 10;
    int foo_result = foo(some_int);
    int bar_result = bar();
    return 0;
}
\end{minted}

Since our method does not work directly with the C source code but instead
works with the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR), lets use clang and emit
IR from the presented C source code in order to demonstrate our method more
clearly:
\footnote {
Flag \mintinline{text}{-S} tells clang to only run preprocess and
compilation steps, while \mintinline{text}{-emit-llvm} makes sure to use the LLVM
representation for assembler and object files. For detailed description of
various clang flags, visit
\url{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangCommandLineReference.html}.
}

\begin{minted}[frame=lines,framesep=10pt]{bash}
  clang -S -emit-llvm example.c -o example.s
\end{minted}

Emitted LLVM IR is stored in the file \mintinline{text}{example.s} and would
have the following structure:\footnote{
Strictly speaking, this is not exactly the IR code that would be emitted by the
clang. We have stripped it out of the module info and comments to make it more
readable. To see the unmodified \mintinline{text}{example.s}, please go to the
\autoref{appendix:example}.
}

\begin{minted}[label=example.s,frame=lines,framesep=10pt]{llvm}
define i32 @foo(i32 %n) #0 {
entry:
  %n.addr = alloca i32, align 4
  %x = alloca i32, align 4
  store i32 %n, i32* %n.addr, align 4
  %0 = load i32, i32* %n.addr, align 4
  %add = add nsw i32 %0, 10
  store i32 %add, i32* %x, align 4
  %1 = load i32, i32* %x, align 4
  ret i32 %1
}

define i32 @bar() #0 {
entry:
  %y = alloca i32, align 4
  store i32 42, i32* %y, align 4
  %0 = load i32, i32* %y, align 4
  ret i32 %0
}

define i32 @main() #0 {
entry:
  %retval = alloca i32, align 4
  %some_int = alloca i32, align 4
  %foo_result = alloca i32, align 4
  %bar_result = alloca i32, align 4
  store i32 0, i32* %retval, align 4
  store i32 10, i32* %some_int, align 4
  %0 = load i32, i32* %some_int, align 4
  %call = call i32 @foo(i32 %0)
  store i32 %call, i32* %foo_result, align 4
  %call1 = call i32 @bar()
  store i32 %call1, i32* %bar_result, align 4
  ret i32 0
}
\end{minted}
\end{myItemize}

% next point
\begin{myItemize}
\item User also provided the line number 7 from the \mintinline{text}{example.c}
as the target, which corresponds to the following C code:
\smallskip

\begin{minted}[label={target C line},frame=lines,framesep=10pt]{C}
  int y = 42;
\end{minted}

Target C line of code corresponds in turn to the following IR instruction:

\begin{minted}[label={target IR instruction},frame=lines,framesep=10pt]{llvm}
  store i32 42, i32* %y, align 4
\end{minted}

Procedure for finding mapping between C code referenced by the user input and
its analogous IR instruction is implementation detail and will be described
in the \autoref{chap:implementation}.
\end{myItemize}

% next point
\begin{myItemize}
\item Now, we can take our method, apply it on the contents of the
\mintinline{text}{example.s} and get the following result stored in the file
\mintinline{text}{example_extracted.s}:

\begin{minted}[label=example\_extracted.s,frame=lines,framesep=10pt]{llvm}
define i32 @bar() #0 {
entry:
  %y = alloca i32, align 4
  store i32 42, i32* %y, align 4
  ret i32 %0
}

define i32 @main() #0 {
entry:
  %bar_result = alloca i32, align 4
  %call1 = call i32 @bar()
  store i32 %call1, i32* %bar_result, align 4
  ret i32 0
}
\end{minted}

As we can see from the \mintinline{text}{example.c}, execution path from
the program entry in the \mintinline{text}{main} function (which we will
call \textbf{source}) to the \textbf{target} does not include function
\mintinline{text}{foo} and its associated instructions, they can be removed.
We are left only with function \mintinline{text}{bar} which contains target,
and necessary instructions in the function \mintinline{text}{main} along with
the \mintinline{text}{main} itself.
\\
\\
We can now take \mintinline{text}{example_extracted.s} and recompile it back
into the functioning executable.\footnote{
More about recompilation in the \autoref{chap:implementation}.
}
\end{myItemize}

\bigskip
% next stuff
Barring implementation specific details (which will be discussed in the
\autoref{chap:implementation}), the method for achieving presented result can be
summarized in the following five steps:

\begin{myEnumerate}
\item Compute data dependencies between instructions.
\item Find connected components in the computed data dependencies inside
every function.
\item Construct call graph, mapping between connected components and functions
that are being called from these components.
\item Find path from source to target in the call graph.
\item Eliminate dead components and functions that do not depend on the path.
\end{myEnumerate}

We will describe in detail each step in the remaining sections of the current
chapter.

% === SECTION ===
\section{Computing Data Dependencies}
\label{sec:design-dep}

% motivation
In order to identify what parts of the IR we can afford to remove, it is
imperative to compute dependencies between instructions. We cannot haphazardly
start removing functions left and right because we may remove some instruction
that would be later needed by another instruction.
This unwise action, may in effect produce inconsistent state, which might leave
IR in the unwanted state or even state that would later fail to recompile back
into the functional executable.

% definitions
We recognize two types of dependencies between IR instructions: control and data
dependencies.
The following terminology and algorithms for computing dependencies that we use
are due to the Marek Chalupa master's thesis \textit{Slicing of LLVM Bitcode}
\cite{dg}.

% TODO: reword this defs?
\begin{myItemize}
\item ``\textbf{Control dependence} explicitly states what nodes are
controlled by which predicate.``
\item ``A \textbf{data dependence} edge is between nodes n and
m iff n defines a variable that m uses and there is no intervening definition
of that variable on some path between n and m. In other words, the definitions
from n reach uses in m.``
\end{myItemize}

% method
The crucial information comes from data dependencies. We need to make sure that
the IR integrity will remain intact after we are done with removing IR
instructions.

Let us demonstrate how would data dependencies look on the example from the
previously presented \mintinline{text}{example.c} source code.
Taking closer look specifically at the function \mintinline{text}{main}:

\begin{minted}[frame=lines,framesep=10pt]{llvm}
define i32 @main() #0 {
entry:
  %retval = alloca i32, align 4
  %some_int = alloca i32, align 4
  %foo_result = alloca i32, align 4
  %bar_result = alloca i32, align 4
  store i32 0, i32* %retval, align 4
  store i32 10, i32* %some_int, align 4
  %0 = load i32, i32* %some_int, align 4
  %call = call i32 @foo(i32 %0)
  store i32 %call, i32* %foo_result, align 4
  %call1 = call i32 @bar()
  store i32 %call1, i32* %bar_result, align 4
  ret i32 0
}
\end{minted}

Looking at the \mintinline{text}{main}, we can construct graph G where V is set
of vertices (in our case vertex is instruction) and E is set of edges (in our
case, edge between vertices V1 and V2 represents data dependency between
instruction V1 and V2).
\footnote{
We compute data dependencies using tool \mintinline{text}{dg}
For more info please visit \url{https://github.com/mchalupa/dg} \cite{dg}.
We will take a closer look at \mintinline{text}{dg} in the
\autoref{chap:implementation}.
}

Computed data dependency graph for instructions from the function
\mintinline{text}{main} is presented in the \autoref{fig:data_deps_graph}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{images/main_dependencies.pdf}
    \caption{Data dependencies graph of the \mintinline{text}{main} function instructions.}
    \label{fig:data_deps_graph}
\end{figure}

Lets take a closer look at the instruction:
\mintinline{llvm}{%some_int = alloca i32, align 4}.
We can see that the following instructions have data dependency on the
\mintinline{llvm}{%some_int}

\begin{minted}[frame=lines,framesep=10pt, escapeinside=||]{llvm}
  store i32 10, i32* %some_int, align 4
  %0 = load i32, i32* %some_int, align 4
\end{minted}

It is apparent that both instructions need \mintinline{llvm}{%some_int} for
their operand. If we were going to remove
\mintinline{llvm}{%some_int = alloca i32, align 4}
without taking into consideration that there are two
instructions that depend on it, we would get into inconsistent state and two
dependent instructions would contain undefined values as their operand.

This would clearly lead into unsuccessful recompilation back into the executable.
In the next chapter, we will discuss how to identify and deal with these kinds
of situations.

% === SECTION ===
\section{Finding Connected Components}
\label{sec:design-components}

% References% TODO: put definition of connected component somewhere

% motivation
We have shown what are inter-instruction data dependencies and how they are
important, but they do not fully solve our problem. If we want to remove
some instruction, it is not enough to know what are the immediate neighbors
in the data dependency graph.

%definitions & method
We can observe, that instruction dependencies tend to cluster and form
components.
Lets take the previously computed dependency graph G and find its connected
components. We will run \emph{Breadth-first search} \cite{clrs} to go
and visit each instruction. If the instruction is not in any component lets
create one and put this instruction inside. If visited instruction is already
in existing component, just skip it and go to the next instruction.
\textbf{TODO: pseudocode}
% TODO: this would be nicely formatted as a pseudocode
% TODO: https://github.com/examon/APEX/blob/197e7a6ec89b7127591df11df0972ff7640d9f00/apex/apex.cpp#L521

After running the above mentioned algorithm, we get the following graph, where
connected components are denoted with different color:

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{images/main_components.pdf}
    \caption{Connected components of the data dependencies graph
    for the \mintinline{text}{main} function instructions. Individual components
    are differentiated by the color.}
    \label{fig:connected_components_graph}
\end{figure}

Having instructions within each function separated into connected components
comes useful especially when we want to figure out if we can safely remove
specific instruction.

Lets take \mintinline{llvm}{%call = call i32 @foo(i32 %0)} as an example.
Having computed connected components, we can see that this instruction
belongs to the \emph{yellow} connected component.

Now, if we were not interested in this particular instruction and wanted to
remove it, we now know that we need to take care a closer look at the whole
component and not only on one particular instruction.

It would not be sufficient to only remove
\mintinline{llvm}{%call = call i32 @foo(i32 %0)} because there are other
instructions within the same component, which means that other members of the
\emph{yellow} component are in dependency relationship with each other.

The good thing is that if we were to remove some unwanted instruction,
for instance \mintinline{llvm}{%retval = alloca i32, align 4} from the \emph{blue} component
we now have the information and know that we should remove also
\mintinline{llvm}{store i32 0, i32* %retval, align 4}. This way, we will not
leave any instructions stranded and with missing dependencies.
As we mentioned earlier, this will ensure that the IR is in the consistent state
and we will be able to recompile the modified IR back into the functioning
executable.

% === SECTION ===
\section{Computing Call Graph}
\label{sec:design-callgraph}

%motivation
In respect to the program execution flow, user provided us the target and
we know the source, which is entry to the program
(\mintinline{text}{main} function).
In order to proceed further, we need to know what possible routes can execution
of the program follow. Computing and walking the call graph of the program
can produce for us this piece of information.

%definition
% TODO: citation needed & improve this, add definition of CFG
\textbf{Call graph}\footnote{
More technically, \emph{call multigraph} \cite{data_flow}.}
is a control flow graph that represents relationship
between program procedures in respect to control flow. \cite{data_flow}
Lets have a call graph $G = \{V, E\}$.
Then, set of vertices $V$ typically represents functions and set of edges $E$
represents transfer of control flow from one function to another.

In our context, call graph represents relationship between individual
connected components (computed in the \autoref{sec:design-components})
and functions that are being called from these components by one of its
instructions.

To demonstrate clearly what exactly is call graph in our situation, lets take
the computed components as shown in the \autoref{fig:connected_components_graph}
and compute call graph (\autoref{fig:call_graph}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{images/main_callgraph.pdf}
    \caption{Call graph computed from the connected components
    as shown in the \autoref{fig:connected_components_graph}.}
    \label{fig:call_graph}
\end{figure}

\textbf{TODO: pseudocode}\\
The way we compute call graph is simply running \emph{Breadth-first search}
to visit all vertices.
Upon visiting call instruction\footnote{\url{https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1CallInst.html}},
we remember what function is being called and the source of the call.

Having call graph represented in the structure shown in the
\autoref{fig:call_graph}
is beneficial for finding
program execution flow path between specific instructions within the program in
relation to their dependencies.

\section{Finding Path from Source to Target}
\label{sec:design-path}

% motivation
Now that we have computed the call graph based on the connected components, it
is possible to find a \textbf{path} from \emph{source} to \emph{target}.

% definitions
\emph{''A path is a simple graph whose vertices can be arranged in a linear sequence in
such a way that two vertices are adjacent if they are consecutive in the sequence,
and are nonadjacent otherwise.''}\cite{graph_theory} In our case, linear
sequence of vertices consists of connected components.

% method
The reason why we constructed our special call graph from the connected
components is now apparent. We want to find a path from source to the target and
in doing so, know which connected components are part of this path or not.

This means that we are finding execution path from main function (source) to the
target.
Potentially, there may exist infinite number of such paths. From
the optimization standpoint, it would be fitting to find all (or at least as
many as we can) paths from source to target and pick some path according to
selected optimization criteria (shortest path, path with smallest connected
components, etc.).

However, for our purposes, it will be sufficient to find any path. We will use
\emph{Breadth-first search} to find such path and work with this path in the
following stage.

As we have presented in the beginng of the \autoref{chap:design}, user specified
as the target line 7 in the \mintinline{text}{example.c} source code, which
corresponds to the following IR instruction:

\begin{minted}[label={target IR instruction},frame=lines,framesep=10pt]{llvm}
  store i32 42, i32* %y, align 4
\end{minted}

Since we have source, target and also call graph, we can run
\emph{Breadth-first search} and obtain path from source to target in the call
graph as shown in the \autoref{fig:path}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{images/main_path.pdf}
    \caption{Path from \textbf{source} to \textbf{target} computed on the
    \autoref{fig:call_graph}. Components in the path are \emph{blue}.
    }
    \label{fig:path}
\end{figure}

Given source and target, we can see from the \autoref{fig:path} that path only
contains two components, one from \mintinline{text}{main} function and another
from \mintinline{text}{bar}. These two components will be the core of the final,
extracted program.

% === SECTION ===
\section{Eliminating Dead Components and Functions}
\label{sec:design-removing}

% motivation
Having successfully found path, we can proceed to the final phase.
We need to eliminate all components and functions that do not impact the path.

% method
If we take a look at the \autoref{fig:removing_prepare}, we can see that
components marked as \emph{red} do not impact the path at all and therefore, we
can mark them for elimination.

The \emph{yellow} component with the single instruction stands out.
We will not remove this component because it contains
terminator instruction \mintinline{llvm}{ret i32 0}.\footnote{
\url{https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1TerminatorInst.html}
More about terminators and why they need special treatment in the
\autoref{chap:implementation}.
}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{images/main_removing_prepare.pdf}
    \caption{
    Components marked for removal are marked \emph{red}. \emph{Yellow} component
    is not marked for removal, because it contains terminator.
    }
    \label{fig:removing_prepare}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[]{images/main_removing_done.pdf}
    \caption{Final state after removing dead components and functions.
    }
    \label{fig:removing_done}
\end{figure}

When we are done going over every component and collecting selected ones for
elimination, we can proceed to actually eliminate them (remove them from the
\mintinline{text}{example.s}).

After we are done with components, we can move to the functions. It may happen
that there will be function not impacting path. For example, taking function
\mintinline{llvm}{i32 @foo(i32 %n)} from the \autoref{fig:removing_prepare},
It is clearly not impacting path. It even has its one and only component marked
for elimination. In this case, we can proceed and remove function
\mintinline{llvm}{i32 @foo(i32 %n)} altogether.

Finally, finished with elimination process, we are left with the result in the
form of the \autoref{fig:removing_done}.

\chapter{Implementation: TODO}
\label{chap:implementation}

Random
\begin{myEnumerate}
\item how do we extract remaining program
\item adding to the path
\item removing non-path functions at the end
\item along with dependencies
\item before and after code samples
\item before and after call graphs
\end{myEnumerate}

% section
\section{Eliminating dead components and functions}
The simplest and seemingly correct way would be to remove every connected
component that is not part of the path that we calculated in the earlier
chapter.

This approach would unfortunately produce inconsistent IR. It not enough to
remove only components in the path. We need to include every other component
that is dependent on any other component that is already part of the path.



Checking if we have any branching dependent on the @path

\begin{myEnumerate}
\item investigating block, collecting basic blocks
\item block has no instruction in "if.*" basic block
\item block has some instruction in "if.*" basic block
\item Find branch instruction that services this BB and add block associated with this branch instruction to the @path.
\end{myEnumerate}

Computing what dependency blocks we want to keep
\begin{myEnumerate}
\item marking every block from @path as to keep
\item Mark as visited to make sure we do not process this block in BFS.
\item setting up initial queue for BFS search
\item Go over @path and figure out if there are any calls outside the @path. If there
are, put those called blocks for investigation into the @queue.
\item running BFS
\item Run BFS from queue and add everything for keeping that is not visited.
\item Collecting everything that we do not want to keep
\item We store blocks and functions that we want to remove into sets.
\end{myEnumerate}

Removing unwanted blocks
\begin{myEnumerate}
\item Remove instructions that we stored earier. Watch out for terminators (do not
remove them).
\item Do not erase instruction that is inside target instructions (We need those
instructions intact.)
\end{myEnumerate}
