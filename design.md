## Design

### Call Graph

- **what is call graph**
- **why do we need callgraph**
- **how is call graph represented**
 - what type of graph it is
 - what are nodes and edges

### Path Finding

- **what is "path" in our situation**
- **why do we need path**
 - what is source & target
- **what algo do we use to find it**
 - BFS
 - one vs multiple paths

### Dependency Resolution

- **what do we mean by "dependency" in our situation**
 - control vs data dependencies
- **how dowe resolve dependencies**
 - dg

### Extraction

- **how do we extract remaining program**
 - adding to the path
 - removing non-path functions at the end
  - along with dependencies
